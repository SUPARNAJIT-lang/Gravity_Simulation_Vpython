# 🌌 Gravity Simulation using VPython

Welcome to the **Gravity Simulation** project powered by **VPython**, created to visualize how gravity works in a beautiful, 3D animated environment. It uses real-time physics to simulate the attraction between celestial bodies using Newton's Law of Gravitation.
